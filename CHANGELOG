(0 15 2) December 6, 2019 - Quality of Life, Function Upgrade, Deprecation, Bug Fix, Detail Update

. Changed ASWU to ASWL (Andrew S. Woo Libraries)                      -> Renamed Utilities Library container to a more appropriate name.
> Added float-type scale constructor for Splash Screens               -> Simple Quality of Life addition.
> Changed Sprite private members to protected members                 -> This allows for inheritance of member variables such as scale and position.
> Added float-type scale constructor for Sprites                      -> Simple Quality of Life addition.
* Render texture with alpha                                           -> OpenEngine rendering now properly renders Alpha values.
/ Fixed alpha blending                                                -> Default shader did not discard alpha values, rendering transparent pixels as white.
* Made Textures reusable                                              -> Textures can now be reused by multiple objects (unless destroyed).
* Added GetSpeed for OrthoCam                                         -> Allows users to get the speed of a camera.
% Removed texture options from DrawQuad                               -> These were unnecessary functions, as the RenderTexture functions did the exact same thing.
* Add RemoveFile function in audio                                    -> Audio files can now be removed. This function is UNTESTED.
> In image loader, specify which image could not be loaded            -> Simple Quality of Life change.
> Changed default Sprite movement behavior                            -> If opposing movement keys are pressed at the same time, sprite will not move.
* Added origin to Mouse Callback class                                -> Cursor origin can now be set, instead of default being bottom left corner
* Changed SplashScreen structure                                      -> Splash Screen no longer inherits from Texture Class, but instead has a texture member
> Made SplashScreen fadetime a requirement, no default value          -> The fade time of Splash screens must now be explicitly defined, instead of leaving a default value
> Changed TextureDimensions type from unsigned int to int             -> No need for explicit casting to int for implicit negation.
* Added Graphics shutdown function                                    -> For future use. Currently used for semantic purposes only.
and various code optimizations!
