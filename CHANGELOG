(3 4 1) January 13, 2020 - Feature Update, Quality of Life, Function Upgrade, Detail Update

-M ! Added Sprite Sheets object                                            -> Sprite Sheet objects can be fed a texture and split into uniform Texes using rows and columns.
-m * Added SpriteSheet renderer function                                   -> 2D Renderer can now render sprite sheets given a spritesheet object pointer.
-m > Sprite Update movement behaviour changed                              -> Pressing opposing directional keys properly negate each other, such that x remains unchanged for each iteration.
-m * Added math class                                                      -> Added various math functions to OpenEngine::Math. These will likely be removed in the future in favor of ASWL::Math.
-M ! Added Collision detection                                             -> Simple collision detection can be done using Axis Aligned Bounding Box for rectangles and Separating Axis Theorem for convex shapes.
-M ! Added Rigidbody physics                                               -> Sprites derivations can be given rigidbodies. They are not preimplemented as of yet.
-m > Added UI namespace for UI elements                                    -> UI elements such as Buttons are now under OpenEngine::UI:: instead of simply OpenEngine::
-p . Updated copyright years                                               -> From 2019 to 2019-2020
and various code optimizations!

(0 15 2) December 6, 2019 - Quality of Life, Function Upgrade, Deprecation, Bug Fix, Detail Update

. Changed ASWU to ASWL (Andrew S. Woo Libraries)                        -> Renamed Utilities Library container to a more appropriate name.
> Added float-type scale constructor for Splash Screens                 -> Simple Quality of Life addition.
> Changed Sprite private members to protected members                   -> This allows for inheritance of member variables such as scale and position.
> Added float-type scale constructor for Sprites                        -> Simple Quality of Life addition.
* Render texture with alpha                                             -> OpenEngine rendering now properly renders Alpha values.
/ Fixed alpha blending                                                  -> Default shader did not discard alpha values, rendering transparent pixels as white.
* Made Textures reusable                                                -> Textures can now be reused by multiple objects (unless destroyed).
* Added GetSpeed for OrthoCam                                           -> Allows users to get the speed of a camera.
% Removed texture options from DrawQuad                                 -> These were unnecessary functions, as the RenderTexture functions did the exact same thing.
* Add RemoveFile function in audio                                      -> Audio files can now be removed. This function is UNTESTED.
> In image loader, specify which image could not be loaded              -> Simple Quality of Life change.
> Changed default Sprite movement behavior                              -> If opposing movement keys are pressed at the same time, sprite will not move.
* Added origin to Mouse Callback class                                  -> Cursor origin can now be set, instead of default being bottom left corner
* Changed SplashScreen structure                                        -> Splash Screen no longer inherits from Texture Class, but instead has a texture member
> Made SplashScreen fadetime a requirement, no default value            -> The fade time of Splash screens must now be explicitly defined, instead of leaving a default value
> Changed TextureDimensions type from unsigned int to int               -> No need for explicit casting to int for implicit negation.
* Added Graphics shutdown function                                      -> For future use. Currently used for semantic purposes only.
and various code optimizations!
