Quality of Life Updates | 12/6/2019
X - Change ASWU to ASWL (Andrew S. Woo Libraries)
X - Add Float-type scale constructor for Splash Screens
X - Change sprite private members to protected members
X - Add Float-type scale constructor for Sprites
X - Render texture with alpha
X - Fix shaders (alpha blending broken)
X - Reusable textures for different sprites (no inhertiance; separate texture variable)
X - Add GetSpeed for OrthoCam
X - Remove texture options from DrawQuad (unnecessary; RenderTexture does this)
X - Add RemoveFile function in audio (UNTESTED)
X - In image loader, specify which image could not be loaded
X - For pre-implemented Sprite::Update, prevented movement when opposing keys are pressed
X > Added origin to mouse position return
X > Change SplashScreen structure such that it does not inherit from Texture class
X > Made SplashScreen fadetime a requirement, no default value
X > Various code optimizations
X > Changed TextureDimensions type from unsigned int to int
x > Added Graphics shutdown function (for future use; currently used for semantic purposes only)
